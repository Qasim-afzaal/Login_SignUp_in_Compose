# Login_SignUp_in_Compose
Jetpack Compose mobile app for user auth and registration, showcasing a modern login/signup UI.
Creating a login/signup project using Jetpack Compose for GitHub involves building a user interface for user authentication. Below is a description of the project:

**Project Title**: Compose Login/Signup Application

**Project Description**:

**Overview**:
The Compose Login/Signup Application is a mobile app project built with Jetpack Compose, designed to provide user authentication and registration functionalities. This project aims to demonstrate how to create a modern and user-friendly login/signup interface using the Jetpack Compose toolkit. Users can sign in with existing credentials or register for a new account.

**Key Features**:

1. **User Registration**: New users can register by providing essential information, including username, email, and password.

2. **User Authentication**: Existing users can log in using their registered email and password.

3. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and validation messages are displayed to users when they enter incorrect or incomplete information during registration or login.

4. **Password Recovery**: Users can initiate a password recovery process if they forget their password. A password reset link is sent to their registered email.

5. **Profile Management**: After logging in, users can access and update their profile information.

**Technology Stack**:

- **Jetpack Compose**: The modern Android UI toolkit for building native UIs.

- **ViewModel**: Used to manage the UI-related data and communication between UI components and the data layer.

- **Firebase Authentication**: For user authentication and password reset.

- **Firebase Firestore**: To store user data securely.

**Project Structure**:

The project should have the following main components:

1. **Screens**: Separate screens for registration, login, password recovery, and the main dashboard.

2. **ViewModels**: ViewModel classes to handle data and business logic for each screen.

3. **Data Model**: Data classes to represent user data.

4. **Repository**: A repository to manage data retrieval and storage, interacting with Firebase.

5. **Firebase Configuration**: Firebase setup and configuration for authentication and Firestore.

6. **Navigation**: Implement navigation between different screens using Jetpack Navigation.

**Getting Started**:

To get started with the project:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

2. Set up Firebase for authentication and Firestore. Update the Firebase configuration in your project.

3. Implement the UI screens and logic for registration, login, and password recovery.
